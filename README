oc-compiler
===========
OC is a simplified C and Java like language specified by the CMPS104a course at UC Santa Cruz. This compiler was
written during Fall of 2014, and recieved high marks.

It compiles to a very limited form of C (I'm gonna change that - it's kinda bullshit to compile from C to C), only
allowing gotos and labels, structs and single assembly-like statements. It performs symbol and type checking, and
properly builds an abtract syntax tree. It performs no optimizations, as the course did not require them.

It uses flex for scanning and bison for parsing, and it written in C++.
